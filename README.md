# DAS - Door Alert System
#### By Richard Collins

## About the project
DAS is a small project I finished in one day, which alerts you by sending an email with the time if your door is opened or closed.
It is used if you want to keep track of if your door if opened while you are away.

A time of flight sensor is used to detect if the door is opened or closed and the data is processed with a raspberry pi zero wh.

In the future I hope to add a:
- Smarted way of detecting if the door is opened or closed as the system can be easilt fooled.
- Timer to count how long the door was left open for.
- Camera setup to capture the moment the door is opened
